# brain_tumor_classifier_CNN
The dataset of [MRI brain tumor images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset). has been generously provided by Kaggle user MASOUD NICKPARVAR. Leveraging this dataset, I have developed a brain tumor classifier using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with PyTorch.
